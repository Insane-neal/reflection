When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It is safer to save the repositories on the cloud side. It is also pretty 
    easy to share with other collabrators when the repositories are saved online. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If I make any changes locally and haven't save it into a commit, automatic 
    syncing may cover whatever I've changed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

`fork` is a clone on github.
`clone` can be clone from remote to local or from local to local.
`branch` has different branches but still share the same ancester.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Keep the local branch up to date is a good habit. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I did it manually before. I didn't have a lot of experiences on  collaborating with others.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

When I want to test some new features or have to change things frequently. It is more clear to do these works in a separate branch. I won't affect others' work until I finish my job.
